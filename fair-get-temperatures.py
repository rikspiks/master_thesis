FAIR Ramp Up-Stabilization Scenario

Here we will use the simple climate model/emulator FAIR (Finite Amplitude Impulse Response) model, running with a wide range of Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) for 3 different ramp up scenarios, in order to gain global temperature time series.

2. Find ppm for Temperature Scenarios

We will now use this median in a "Ramp Up" scenario 
in FAIR. Ramp up means that we will increase CO2 concentrations 
continously for 200 years. Then we set the concentration 
to a constant value = Stabilization. 
We will try this for several CO2 concentrations to find,
 which ppm value corresponds to 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 5Â°C global warming.
