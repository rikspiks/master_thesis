'''
At total of 13 959 cases, = ? 0.2 % of all model runs. (3 855 within 0.5-1Â°C scenario)
They were constricted to (i) negative coupling between AMOC and WAIS, and
    (ii) high coupling strengths of 0.7 to 1. 
    Nonetheless, oscillations occurred in each scenario and with 
    nearly all ECS values (994 of 1000 cases).
